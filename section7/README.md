The baseline performance results presented in Section 7 of the D5.1 report were obtained by running the IFS benchmarking suite RAPS, on ECMWF's Atos.
The closed-source RAPS benchmarking and procurement suite contains input data and configurations for a wide range of IFS use-cases and a wide range of spatial resolutions.

A 10-day forecast of atmospheric resolution Tco319 coupled with an ocean running on an ORCA025 grid was used.
It was run on 4, 6 and 8 nodes of the ECMWF Atos HPC system, each of which is comprised of two 64c AMD Epyc Rome 7742 CPUs, clocked at 2.25 GHz.

The timing data is provided by the DRHOOK profiling infrastructure which is found in the IFS source base.
