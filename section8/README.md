The two IFS dwarfs used in OpenCUBE are now open-source projects.
The cloud microphysics kernel CLOUDSC is available at 
https://github.com/ecmwf-ifs/dwarf-p-cloudsc
and the spherical transforms library can be found at
https://github.com/ecmwf-ifs/ectrans


Both projects come with a benchmarking driver, which is used for the establishment of performance results. The drivers are compiled by default when the dwarfs are compiled.
