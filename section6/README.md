The baseline performance metrics presented in Section 6 of the D5.1 report are the result of running the PProc and Polytope benchmarks described in the report on ECMWF's Kubernetes Cluster.

The results for the three runs of PProc benchmark have been obtained by running the `run-benchmark.sh` script in https://github.com/opencube-horizon/pproc-workflow. The figures shown in Table 4 are contained in the subdirectory `pproc-data`, and Figure 8 in the report can be obtained from the Task Stream tab of the performance report `extreme_2t_window72/performance_report.html`, generated by Dask. 

The Polytope benchmarking results have been obtained by running the `run-benchmark.sh` script in https://github.com/opencube-horizon/polytope-benchmark and are also provided in the subdirectory `polytope-data`.
